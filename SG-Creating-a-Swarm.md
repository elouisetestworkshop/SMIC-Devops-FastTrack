## Configure Managers
- Use the IP address of your server while configuring your manager:

```
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.31.21.64
```
    
- We can copy the output to another file or safe location so we may have easy access to the token we'll need to join additional nodes to the swarm. 
- To avoid any confusion, for this example, we have changed the name of the manager server to `manager1`:

```   
[user@manager1 ~]$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.31.21.64
Swarm initialized: current node (6h59lkua4alffyoneglx6l427) is now a manager.
```
 
- After successfully initializing the swarm and adding the first node as a manager, Docker will give you the command to add workers:
  
``` 
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-40xcrb7c92mjnapxvoulp15zkky0zopk7u8cc6yd9vglya12v6-epqvj5m5859m05fry5x1p02dg 172.31.21.64:2377
```

- The first string after SWMTKN-1 is a unique identifier for the swarm, the second is the key for whether the node joins the swarm as a manager or worker.
- We can request the token be provided again:

```  
[user@manager1 ~]$ docker swarm join-token worker
```    
- To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:
    
```
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-40xcrb7c92mjnapxvoulp15zkky0zopk7u8cc6yd9vglya12v6-epqvj5m58b5m05fry5x1p02dg 172.31.21.64:2377
```

- To add additional managers: 

``` 
docker swarm join-token manager
```

- Then run the command Docker provides on the node you want to add as a manager.
- To see what nodes are currently configured:

```
docker node ls
```

## Adding Nodes
 
We will need a second server, which weâ€™ll refer to as `worker1`, with Docker installed. 

- Using the token provided by the steps above, join `worker1` to the swarm. Do not copy and paste the command below as the token will differ: 

``` 
[user@worker1 ~]$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-40xcrb7c92mjnapxvoulp15zkky0zopk7u8cc6yd9vglya12v6-epqvj5m5859m05fry5x1p02dg 172.31.21.64:2377
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
```
          
- Repeat the previous step on all of the workers that need configuration.  

## Backup and Restore On the Manager

- Create a service of webserver instances: 
 
```
docker service create --name backupweb --publish 80:80 httpd --replicas 2
```
    
- Confirm service creation: 
  
```  
docker service ls
```  
     
- You can see what node the containers are running in with `docker service ps`:

```
[user@manager1 ~]$ docker service ps backupweb
ID                  NAME                IMAGE               NODE             DESIRED STATE       CURRENT STATE          ERROR               PORTS
r5h3eovajscx        backupweb.1         httpd:latest        worker1         Running             Running 27 seconds ago
pk05dezy13v2        backupweb.2         httpd:latest        manager1         Running             Running 27 seconds ago
```

- You can see here that one container is running on `worker1` and the other on `manager1`.

## Test Our Backup Service Using the *root* User

Inside of the `/var/lib/docker/swarm` are files that contain information related to our docker swarm. All of these items need to be backed up. 

To test the service:
1. Stop the Docker service:
    `systemctl stop docker`
2. Make a directory to copy these files in to:
   ` mkdir /root/swarm`
3. Copy swarm files over to our new directory:
    `cp -rf /var/lib/docker/swarm /root/swarm`
4. Start the docker service again:
    `systemctl start docker`
5. Confirm we have 2 replicas running:
     `docker service ls`
6. Let's create a backup:
    `tar cvf swarm.tar swarm`
7. Spin up another server with Docker installed. Do not add it to the swarm!
8. Copy our files over to the new server:
    `scp swarm.tar user@<newserverip>`
9. Now stop docker on all of our nodes. (This is to mimic a swarm crash.) 

## Recovery Using the *root* User 

1. On the new server, remove the swarm files currently located at `/var/lib/docker` as we will be using this server as a recovery platform:
    `rm -rf /var/lib/docker/swarm/`
2. Make a temporary directory and untar our file:
    `mkdir tmp && cd tmp` 
3. Untar the `swar.tar` file: 
    `tar xvf ../swarm.tar `
4. Move the files over:
    `mv /home/user/tmp/swarm  /var/lib/docker`
5. Start the Docker service: 
     `systemctl start docker` 
6. As soon as Docker starts, initialize a new cluster: 
     `docker swarm init --force-new-cluster`
